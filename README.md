## Examination text

Build an imperative and functional interpreter with OCaml, with those features:

- Insert the String type in the language and some other functions. (ex: length, concat, ...)
- Implement the reflect command. (ex: eval() in JavaScript)

## Quick start

Before you can download and run our interpreter, you must download:

- [OCaml Programming Language](https://ocaml.org)

Now to can run our code, go to the project folder of the imperative of functional interpreter and execute those commands in the terminal:

```
ocaml
#use "main.ml";;
```
